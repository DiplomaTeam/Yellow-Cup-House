	<p>Our Story
	3 families were friends for years and we were having a chat of having own coffee shops almost for as long as we knew each other. Two of the families were in construction business and as part of the job guys had to re-do and construct from scratch number of coffee shops (including those of Java). Some family members of all the families have been working in catering at different times and business was well know to majority.
Change came when one family being on the holiday in Malasia visited a cafe called "Yellow House". They have liked atmosphere so much that decided not to hold any more and start "building own dream".
That's how Yellow Cup House was born: Style and Experience of years in catering business and best possible Family like Atmosphere"

My friend and I decided to stop in for breakfast on a whim and we were very surprised by how affordable it was! You could get a coffee and a breakfast sandwich for 4€. They had a variety of pastries, porridge, and full breakfast items. The place itself was very clean and I really enjoyed the decorations too! I got a combined coffee and egg mayo and bacon sandwich which turned out to be better than I expected.</h5> </a>
